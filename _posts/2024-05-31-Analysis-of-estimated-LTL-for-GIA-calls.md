# Telomere length estimation in MVP WGS data using GIA
Leukocyte telomere length estimation for 103,763 MVP WGS samples using GIA has been completed.


#### 1. Sample count:

|Category|Count|
|-|-|
|Count of WGS DR2 samples|104,923| 
|Count of DR2 samples with estimated LTL|104,903|
|Count of samples with GIA calls|183,545|
|Count of samples common between WGS DR2/LTL and GIA calls|102,703|
|Count of samples that DO NOT have GIA calls | 2200 (104903-102703)|


All the analysis have been explained in this [jupyter notebook](https://github.com/va-big-data-genomics/mvp-telomere-analysis/blob/main/analysis-pipeline/LTL_analysis_GIA_104k.ipynb)
