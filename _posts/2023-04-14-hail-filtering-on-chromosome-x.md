We've had some issues and concerns about filtering variants/genotypes on chromosome X, specifically with regards to sex specific filtering on the X chromosome which is haploid in most males and diploid in most females. Please review this notebook I created, characterizing our variant/genotype filtering methods as applied to chromosome X.

Unfortunately, because of issue with rendering the images, you'll have to download [this HTML file](https://github.com/va-big-data-genomics/mvp-wgs-snp-indel-release/blob/feat-sex-chr/SNPs-Indels/data_release_2023/notebooks/sex-chr-characterize-filtering%20(1).html) and load it on your local machine.
